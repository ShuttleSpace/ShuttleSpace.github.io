It uses a Lua script to maintain project builds, but is driven by a dependency free core program written in C. Compared with Makefiles or CMake, the configuration syntax is much concise and intuitive. As such, it&#39;s friendly to novices while still maintaining the flexibly required in a build system. With Xmake, you can focus on your project instead of the build.</p><p>Xmake can be used to directly build source code (like with Make or Ninja), or it can generate project source files like CMake or Meson. It also has a <em>built-in</em> package management system to help users integrate C/C++ dependencies.</p><p>If you want to know more, please refer to: the <a href="https://xmake.io/#/getting_started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Documentation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://gitee.com/tboox/xmake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gitee</a>.
